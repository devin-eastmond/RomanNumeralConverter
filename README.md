# Running the Code

The code can be run from a terminal by navigating to the _executable_ folder and running the command `java Main`. If you would like to recompile the code, you can navigate to the _src_ folder and run the command `javac Main.java` and then `java Main` to run it.

# Documentation

All classes, methods, and variables are documented with javadocs, and several methods contain additional inline comments when necessary.

# Testing

If you are interested in running the test cases in `RomanNumeralTest.java`, they can be run by opening the project in IntelliJ (if you have it downloaded) and running the test files from there.

# Time Spent

I spent about three hours writing the code, thirty minutes testing it, and thirty minutes writing the documentation, uploading it to GitHub, etc.
